rightTitle: "Canon"
rightDescription: "We believe the 66 books (39 Old Testament and 27 New Testament) of the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.  They are fully innerrant in their original manuscripts. They are superior to all human authority.  We believe that the canon of the Church is closed and that the Holy Spirit is no longer granting new revelation that is equal in authority to the Holy Scriptures."
